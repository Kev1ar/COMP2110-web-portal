# Project Part-3: Deployment and Final Reports (Group)

## Notes:
## Part 3 of our project, basically two parts to it

- Deploying the WebApp
- Writing a report

Writing a Report

3000 word limit
Some sections we do as a group, others are individual that we then combine together.
We are to add it as report.md in our repository that we've been working on. Afterwards I think we need to submit the .md file on iLearn.
