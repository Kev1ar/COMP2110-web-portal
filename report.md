Project Part-3: Deployment and Final Reports (Group)

Notes:
Part 3 of our project, basically two parts to it

- Deploying the WebApp
- Writing a report

Deploying the WebApp

Only one of us has to this. Instructions on how to do it can be found on iLearn.

Writing a Report

3000 word limit
Some sections we do as a group, others are individual that we then combine together.
We are to add it as report.md in our repository that we've been working on. Afterwards I think we need to submit the .md file on iLearn.

The main parts of it are as follows,

Deployment Details (Group)

- what
- how

What we implemented (Group)

- explaining the main portal functionalities (not including the widgets I think)

What did the group find challenging?(Group/Individual)

- if you found something challenging just add it here

What was rewarding for the group/individual? (Group/Individual)

- if you found something interesting/rewarding add it here

Individual reflection (~~375 words each)

- which widget did you choose and why?
- what was most challenging part of the project for you?
